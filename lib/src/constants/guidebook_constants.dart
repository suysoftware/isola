The purpose of this app is to enable the best student life possible for all the young people craving to socialize more with their peers and to take offline what started online. With Isola students can easily be matched with like minded peers who live in the same city and they can post pictures, videos and messages. Isola is like no other app on the market and it has the power to change the student experience. The next versions of this app will address a broader audience and connect to each other more people who share the same lifestyle.";
